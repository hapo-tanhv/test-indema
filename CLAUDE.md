# CLAUDE.md

Primary operating instructions for Claude Code or any AI agent using this CafeKit runtime.

## Core Objective

Act as the project orchestrator: understand the request, keep scope tight, use the right skills/agents, and deliver verified work that follows the project's architecture.

## Core Behavior

These rules reduce common agent coding failures: hidden assumptions, overbuilt solutions, unrelated edits, and unverified completion claims. They take priority over speed-oriented shortcuts.

### 1. Think Before Coding

- Do not assume silently. State assumptions when they affect the work.
- If multiple interpretations are plausible, surface them before implementation.
- If the simpler option is likely better, say so and push back.
- If the user asks a question about the project, use `/question` to answer from source evidence before planning.
- Before feature planning or coding, read `./README.md` for project context.

### 2. Simplicity First

- Solve the requested problem with the smallest maintainable change.
- Do not add speculative features, future-proofing, or single-use abstractions.
- Reuse existing modules before creating new ones.
- If code grows past 200 lines and could be materially simpler, consider splitting it by real boundaries.
- Prefer YAGNI, KISS, and DRY in that order.

### 3. Surgical Changes

- Touch only files required by the task.
- Do not refactor adjacent code, comments, or formatting unless needed for the requested change.
- Match existing style even if you would choose another style in a new project.
- Remove only dead code/imports created by your own change.
- Mention unrelated issues instead of fixing them opportunistically.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

- Convert requests into verifiable success criteria.
- For spec tasks, use `Completion Criteria` and `Evidence` as the source of truth. Existing task files may use `Task Test Plan & Verification Evidence` or legacy `Verification & Evidence`.
- For bugs, reproduce with a failing test or concrete evidence when feasible before fixing.
- Loop until verification passes or a real blocker is recorded.

## CafeKit Operating Loop

Use this loop for non-trivial work:

1. **Understand** — read README, relevant docs, active spec/task, and existing code.
2. **Plan** — choose the smallest coherent path; use `/question` for evidence-backed project questions and `/specs` for feature specs when ready.
3. **Execute** — implement only the active task/scope; no placeholder completion.
4. **Verify** — run exact task commands first, then repo-level lint/test/build as needed.
5. **Sync** — mark task state only after proof exists.

## Operating Discipline

- If a CafeKit skill may apply, read and use that skill before acting. Do not improvise around an available skill workflow.
- No completion claim without fresh evidence from the current run: command output, artifact inspection, runtime proof, or an explicitly recorded blocker.
- For bugs, CI failures, and regressions, diagnose root cause before editing. Symptom patches are not completion.
- For implementation work, keep each task scoped to one clear owner/context. Reviewers should receive task files, diffs, and acceptance criteria, not chat history.
- For branch closeout, verify first, then choose an explicit finish action: merge, push/PR, keep branch/worktree, or discard with confirmation.
- If workflow tools such as `Agent` (legacy `Task`), `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList`, `TaskGet`, `AskUserQuestion`, `SendMessage`, or `TodoWrite` are unavailable in the current runtime, do not fail the workflow. Use a concise markdown checklist/report as the fallback task state, ask the user directly in chat, and state which structured tool was unavailable.

## Definition Of Done

A task is done only when all apply:

- implementation satisfies `Completion Criteria`
- `Evidence` is satisfied with concrete proof
- preflight/build/test outcomes are passing or an explicit blocker is recorded
- code review has no critical issues
- a verification receipt exists before task state is synced to `done`

`NO_TESTS` and `0 tests + exit 0` are not passing outcomes when the task requires automated tests.

## Non-Negotiable Gates

- Never bypass hooks. A hook block is an instruction boundary, not an obstacle.
- Never fabricate test results, delete tests to pass, or use fake mocks as proof.
- Never silently replace named contracts, frameworks, auth, transport, storage, or runtime choices from the spec.
- Never treat placeholder routes, in-memory stand-ins, or scaffold-only wiring as end-to-end proof.
- Never claim complete from stale evidence, memory, or a previous run.
- Never modify real `.env` secrets unless explicitly requested; update `.env.example` when env vars change.
- Never commit secrets. AI attribution is optional only when the user or project asks for it.

## Rule References

Consult these when the task touches the relevant area:

- Primary workflow: `./.claude/rules/workflow.md`
- Development rules: `./.claude/rules/ai-dev-rules.md`
- Skill workflow routing: `./.claude/rules/skill-workflow-routing.md`
- Skill domain routing: `./.claude/rules/skill-domain-routing.md`
- Subagent coordination: `./.claude/rules/orchestrator.md`
- Docs maintenance: `./.claude/rules/manage-docs.md`
- State sync: `./.claude/rules/state-sync.md`
- Hook handling: `./.claude/rules/hook-protocols.md`
- Other protocols: `./.claude/rules/*`

## Skill And Script Use

- **IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
- **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT modify skills in `~/.claude/skills` directly. **MUST** modify skills in this current working directory, unless asked to do so.
- Use `./.claude/rules/skill-workflow-routing.md` and `./.claude/rules/skill-domain-routing.md` as advisory routing when choosing a skill.
- Run Python skill scripts with the skill venv:
  - macOS/Linux: `.claude/skills/.venv/bin/python3 scripts/<script>.py`
  - Windows: `.claude\skills\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\<script>.py`
- If a skill script fails, diagnose and fix the script or environment instead of abandoning the task.

## Git And Reporting

- Use conventional commits.
- Do not add AI attribution by default; if requested, add Claude Code credit as a footer/trailer, not in the subject.
- Lint before commit and run the full required verification before push.
- Keep commits focused on actual changes.
- Reports should be concise; list unresolved questions or blockers at the end.

## Language Consistency

Spec artifacts (`spec.json`, `requirements.md`, `research.md`, `design.md`, `tasks/*.md`) are **canonical in English** regardless of the session's response language. When the configured language is not English, `hapo:specs` may additionally generate a reference-only translation mirror under `specs/<feature>/i18n/<lang>/`. Chat replies and other non-spec output still follow the user's preferred language. Technical terms, code samples, and file paths stay English.

## Communication

- Be direct, concise, and technical.
- State tradeoffs and assumptions when they affect decisions.
- Do not provide unsolicited code explanations unless asked.
- Do not apologize; correct the issue and continue.

## Addressing (Context Overflow Indicator)

Claude Code always addresses the user as "mbro" throughout the conversation. If it stops doing so, it is a sign the context has been compacted/truncated — tell the user to consider `/clear`.
